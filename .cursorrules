This project uses Tailwind CSS 4 as the exclusive styling system.

When generating or modifying any UI component:

1. Use ONLY official Tailwind 4 utility classes.
2. Follow the visual style and patterns shown on the Tailwind CSS website and documentation.
3. Do NOT generate inline styles unless explicitly requested.
4. Do NOT create custom CSS rules unless absolutely necessary.
5. Do NOT invent class names or use classes from older Tailwind versions.
6. Use Tailwind's standard design scales:
   - Spacing: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, etc.
   - Colours: slate, gray, zinc, neutral, stone, blue, indigo, violet, red, etc.
   - Radius: rounded, rounded-md, rounded-lg, rounded-xl, rounded-2xl.
   - Shadows: shadow-sm, shadow, shadow-md, shadow-lg, shadow-xl.
7. Structure all JSX elements semantically (button, label, input, section, dialog, nav, header, main, etc.).
8. For interactive components, use Tailwind variants where appropriate:
   - hover:, focus:, focus-visible:, active:, disabled:
   - aria-selected:, aria-expanded:, data-[state=open]:
9. Use flex/grid utilities for layout instead of custom CSS.
10. When colours, borders or spacing are unclear, default to Tailwind's official examples.
11. If a component needs variants (size, colour, intent, state), generate them using cva() + twMerge().
12. Always match the look and feel of components displayed on tailwindcss.com.
13. Assume this project uses:
    - Vite
    - React + TypeScript
    - tailwind-merge
    - class-variance-authority

Additional requirements for robust Tailwind usage:

14. Before creating a new component, check existing components in src/components/ and align with their Tailwind patterns and overall visual language.
15. Design responsively by default. Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:) where appropriate, and avoid hard-coded widths/heights that break on smaller screens.
16. All components MUST be ready for light and dark mode. For any background, border or text colour:
    - Either pair light and dark utilities (for example, bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-950, text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50),
    - Or use existing semantic theme classes if they are defined in the project.
    Avoid hard-coded colours or styles that only work in one theme.
17. Prefer standard Tailwind utilities over arbitrary values. Only use arbitrary values (for example, w-[123px]) when there is no suitable utility and include a short code comment explaining why.
18. Accessibility is mandatory. Use semantic HTML elements and Tailwind's accessibility utilities (sr-only, focus-visible) together with appropriate aria-* attributes. Ensure keyboard navigation works.
19. Keep spacing consistent. Follow the spacing rules documented in spacing.md in this repository and reuse common spacing utilities (for example, p-4, p-5, gap-4, gap-6) instead of inventing new arbitrary spacing on every component.
20. Before adding custom CSS, ask: "Can this be done with Tailwind utilities?" If yes, use utilities. Only add custom CSS for things Tailwind cannot handle cleanly (for example, complex animations or unusual layout edge cases).
21. Build complex UIs by composing smaller, reusable Tailwind-styled components (Button, Card, Panel, Toolbar, etc.) rather than writing monolithic components with large custom style blocks.
22. During code review or refactoring:
    - Remove inline styles (unless explicitly required).
    - Remove unnecessary custom CSS classes and convert them to Tailwind utilities.
    - Check that responsive and dark-mode states make sense in both light and dark themes.
    - Confirm semantic HTML and accessibility attributes are in place.
23. If unsure about a pattern, prefer solutions that match Tailwind's documentation and examples rather than inventing new visual styles.
