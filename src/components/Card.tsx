/**
 * Card Component Re-export
 * 
 * This file provides a convenient re-export of the UI Card component
 * from the ui subfolder. This allows components to import Card from
 * "@/components/Card" instead of "@/components/ui/Card" for consistency
 * with other top-level component exports (Button, etc.).
